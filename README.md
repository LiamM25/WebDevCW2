# Web Application Development 2 CW2

The Scottish Pantry Network (TSPN) Web Application was developed as part of GCU coursework for Web Application Development 2. The application is designed to aid in the sharing of surplus food among individuals and local food pantries, with the aim of addressing food insecurity in the community.

The website uses a runtime database populated with testing data for demonstration purposes.
